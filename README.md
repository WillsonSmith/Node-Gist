Node-Gist
=========

A Node app to grab all Gist IDs of selected user. To be used in conjunction with github gist embedding.

Instructions:
1. Replace 'username' with the username you wish to grab gists for
2. replace 'contact' with your email, github requires this for connections that are not authenticated
3. run this on heroku or your own hosting (procfile is for heroku)
